# Chuck Norris apollo react app 
This is a react app with TypeScript intended to query the [Chuck norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/api "Chuck norris api"). This app uses a local GraphQL API to be used as a wrapper between the Chuck norris api and the React app. The local api is found [Here](https://github.com/brungo1995/chuck-apollo-server "GraphQl api").

## Prerequisites
 * Node Js installed at least version 12

## How to run the api
 * Clone the repo
 * On the root folder run 
```bash
    npm install
```
 * This should install all dependencies
 * Make sure that the [Local GraphQl API](https://github.com/brungo1995/chuck-apollo-server "GraphQl api") is up and running otherwise, you won't be able to query the API 
 * Then run 
 ```bash
    npm run start
```
 * The start script will start the app on port 3000 if available and launch the browser 
 * Enjoy the APP and have a laugh ðŸ˜¹
